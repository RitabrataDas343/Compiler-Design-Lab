This assembly code is generated for x86-64 architecture 
and is the result of compiling the C program provided to 
check the endianness of the machine.

The first few lines of the assembly code 
define the source file name, the text section and the 
read-only data section.

.LC0 and .LC1 are two read-only data sections that 
contain the string "Little endian" and "Big endian" respectively.
 These strings are later used by the program.

The next few lines define the main function and set up 
the stack frame for it. The instructions pushq %rbp and movq 
%rsp, %rbp are used to set up the stack frame pointer.

The instruction movl $1, -20(%rbp) assigns the value 1 to the 
variable "num". The instruction leaq -20(%rbp), %rax loads the 
address of "num" into the register %rax.

The instruction movq %rax, -16(%rbp) stores the address 
of "num" in the memory location pointed to by the register %rbp.

The instruction movzbl (%rax), %eax loads the value stored at 
the memory location pointed to by %rax into the register %eax. 
This value is the first byte of the "num" variable, which is 
used to determine the endianness of the machine.

The instruction testb %al, %al performs a bitwise AND 
operation between the value in %al and itself. If the 
result is zero, it means that the first byte of "num" is 
0, indicating that the machine is big endian. If the result 
is non-zero, the machine is little endian.

The instruction je .L2 jumps to the label .L2 if the 
result of the previous instruction is zero. This is the 
case for big endian machines.

The instruction leaq .LC0(%rip), %rax loads the 
address of the string "Little endian" into the register 
%rax. The instruction movq %rax, %rdi stores the address 
of the string in the register %rdi, which is the first 
argument of the puts function.

The instruction call puts@PLT calls the puts 
function, which prints the string "Little endian" 
to the console.

For big endian machines, the program jumps to 
label .L2, where the instruction leaq .LC1(%rip), 
%rax loads the address of the string "Big endian" 
into the register %rax. The instruction movq %rax, 
%rdi stores the address of the string in the register 
%rdi, which is the first argument of the puts function.

The instruction call puts@PLT calls the puts function, 
which prints the string "Big endian" to the console.

The instruction movl $0, %eax sets the return 
value of the main function to 0.

The instructions movq -8(%rbp), %rdx and subq %fs:40, 
%rdx are used to check for stack overflow and 
call the __stack_chk_fail@PLT function if an 
overflow is detected.

The instruction leave is used to restore the 
stack frame pointer and the instruction ret is 
used to return from the main function.
